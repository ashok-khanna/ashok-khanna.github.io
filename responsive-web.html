  <h1>Chapter 1: Our Responsive Web</h1>
  <p>We should embrace the flexibility and variablity inherent to the web, and build sites that adapt to the media that renders them. Together with utilising standards-based technologies to ensure consistent implementation across browsers, responsive web design consists of three ingredients:
    <li>
      <ol><b>A flexible, grid-based layout</b></ol>
      <ol><b>Flexible images and media</b>, and</ol>
      <ol><b>Media queries</b>, a module from the CSS3 specification</ol>
    </li>
  </p>
