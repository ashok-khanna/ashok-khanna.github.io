This repo represents the static website of math.dev. This readme file will contain notes on the development and code of this website.

**Index.Html**
This is the primary landing page for the website. It can be used as a template for all other pages as it includes all the relevant scripts, stylesheets and page structure (we have a constant structure across the website for now).

**Styles.Css**
This is the stylesheet for the whole website.

**MathJax Folder**
We load MathJax locally for our project, given its importance. However, this can be replaced with CDN if we want.

**Fonts Folder**
This is where we save all the fonts we want to use in the website (locally loaded).

**Helper Folder**
This contains some helper files, plus some files that I felt good to keep a copy of, but haven't used in the website yet (e.g. Eric Meyer's CSS reset sheet & jQuery source code). The 'about.html', 'quote.html' and 'footer.html' files in this folder are populated on every page via jQuery, but we only need to edit them once here.


**Outstanding Tasks**
- Design Math.Dev Logo
- Decide whether Math.Dev logo should have a color row at the top?
