<article>
<p>Welcome to <b>Math.Dev</b>, a website focused on building a hyperlinked web of mathematical theorems and their proofs. This website also serves as my personal blog.</p>

<p>Most of my website is under construction and will be progressively built over 2020 - 2022. During this time, my blog posts will likely be the main attraction of this website, so please do check it out.</p>

<p>I would love to connect with you, the reader, and share my future content or even collaborate if the right opporutnity arises. A main purpose of my website is to connect with like-minded peers. If you are interested, please sign up to my mailing list and I'll send you a maximum of 1 message per month, and lkiely much less (i.e. only when it makes sense). However, I will definitely reach out initially just to say hi and make the connection between us.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
My name is Ashok Khanna and I am an Australian mathematics, programming and design enthusiast, currently living in Dubai. I have a Masters degree in Quantitative Finance and I work in currently work in marketing and investor relations. Thus, my experience is an overlap of technical ability within mathematics and computer science and practical experience in clear, effective communication. This website is the culmination of the two.
