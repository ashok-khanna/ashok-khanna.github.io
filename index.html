<p>Welcome to Math.Dev, a website focused on building a hyperlinked web of mathematical theorems and their proofs. This website also serves as my personal blog. Most of my website is under construction and will be progressively built over 2020 - 2022. During this time, my blog posts will likely be the main attraction of this website, so please do check it out.</p>
