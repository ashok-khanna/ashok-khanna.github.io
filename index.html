<h1>Math.Dev</h1>
<p>Welcome to Math.Dev, my personal homepage. Various projects will be hosted here over time.</p>

<h2>Blog Roll</h2>
<p>From time to time, I <a href="https://medium.math.dev">blog on Medium</a> on various topics, usually on guides for technologies that I use. Together, they have been read over 15,000 times. Some highlights include:</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.math.dev/lisp-the-web-4c00c88d11f9">Lisp & the Web: Creating Web Applications with Common Lisp</a></p>
<p><a href="https://medium.math.dev/an-introduction-to-lisp-packages-7a9ee352006e">An introductory guide to Lisp Packages</a></p>
<p><a href="https://medium.math.dev/formatting-lisp-5e28020b8bac">An introductory guide to Formatting Lisp Code</a></p>
<p><a href="https://medium.math.dev/crud-webapp-with-angular-node-js-mysql-5733fd1b8fc4">CRUD WebApp With Angular, Node.JS, MySQL</a></p>


<h2>Project Roll</h2>
<p>Below are some of the projects I have completed recently. The code is freely available on my <a href="https://github.com/ashok-khanna">GitHub Profile</a> and they serve as a way of giving back to the open source community. Together, they have over 400 GitHub stars.</p>

<h3>Beautiful PDFs from HTML</h3>
<p>Date Published: April 4, 2021</p>
<p>In this popular guide (which trended to the top of HN and received over 150,000 reads), I walk through the basic steps of creating well-formatted PDFs from HTML & CSS, using the Paged.Js JavaScript library as a polyfill. I believe this approach is very useful, because the combination of HTML and CSS allows you to programmatically create beautifully typeset content without reliance on MS Word or other packages.</p>

<h3>Online Math Editor</h3>
<p>Date Published: March 1, 2021</p>
<p>This is an interesting project that combines a high quality rich text editor for the web (TinyMCE) with the power of MathJax.</p>

<h3>Common Lisp by Example</h3>
<p>Date Published: November 21, 2020</p>
<p>In 2020 I began to learn the Common Lisp programming language. To improve my own understanding and serve as a reference for later, I started compiling a set of code examples, which culminated in a 52 page guidebook on the language. It has over 150 stars on GitHub and is well received. I personally don't refer to it anymore, but if you want to learn Lisp, I recommend it!</p>

<h3>RPN 30</h3>
<p>Date Published: February 4, 2019</p>
<p>Where it all began. As a long time fan of the HP 12C, I wrote a high quality RPN calculator for the iPhone, taking design cues from Apple's stock calculator, with some unique twists. It has over 10,000 downloads and rated 4.8 / 5 stars on the App store, with many reviews. This project was my first step back into programming after a decade of absence.</p>

<h2>Mirror of CLTL2E</h2>
<p>Finally, I have cloned the HTML repository of Common Lisp the Language, 2nd Edition by Guy Steele and host a <a href="cltl/clm/clm.html">mirror of this important reference book</a> on this website.</p>
