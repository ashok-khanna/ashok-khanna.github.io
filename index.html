    <h3>Beautiful PDFs from HTML</h3>
    <p>Date Published: April 4, 2021</p>
    <p>In this popular guide (which trended to the top of HN and received over 150,000 views), I walk through the basic steps of creating well-formatted PDFs from HTML & CSS Code, using the Paged.Js JavaScript library. I believe this approach is very useful, because the combination of HTML and CSS allows you to programmatically create beautifully typeset contnet without reliance on MS Word or other packages. Paged.Js filled in the missing piece of being able to export nicely to PDF.</p>

	<h3>Online Math Editor</h3>
	<p>Date Published: March 1, 2021</p>
	<p>This is an interesting project that combines a high quality rich text editor for the web (TinyMCE) with the power of MathJax. It could be a useful base for an online math publishing platform, and I may develop it further in the future. I have also written <a href="https://writer.math.dev/landing.html">an introduction on how to use it</a>.</p>
