    <h1>RPN 30</h1>
    <p>Reverse Polish Notation ("RPN") is an alternative way to complete calculations. Many find it to be more intuitive and user-friendly than the "normal" way of using a calculator. RPN works entering numbers first and then the operator (i.e. 53 47 + will give you 53 + 47 = 100). RPN 30 is my artistic interpretation of the ideal form for a calculator, taking inspiration from the standard Apple iPhone calculator. No ads, no paid features, always free to use.</p>

	<h3>An everyday RPN calculator done right (5 stars)</h3>
	<p>Finally ! A non-scientific, non-cluttered RPN calculator usable on a daily basis. Thanks to the dev for bringing the power of RPN to everyday calculations without compromising on simplicity and ease of use.</p>

	<h3>Simple and Clean (5 stars)</h3>
	<p>This is great! Finally someone has created an RPN calculator with as good and simple UI as the Apple calculator. 99% of the time I don‚Äôt need the functions of a scientific or business calculator, but I still want RPN to be able to do simple transactions speedily. Now I have it ‚Äî thank you!</p>

	<h3>Elegant Programming (5 stars)</h3>
	<p>Very nicely written app. I‚Äôve been using RPN calculators for decades, and this is the best simple but robust calc app around.</p>

	<h3>Superb graceful RPN calculator (5 stars)</h3>
	<p>Elegant and intuitive interface. Loads fast and looks great. I would make the following substitutions: (1) Drop the radical, which can be achieved with 1/x and y^x (2) Drop % and T% which are easily replaced with arithmetic operations. Maybe drop D% too although it's more useful. (3) Add the basic trig functions, at least sin and cos (with tan available as sin/cos). asin and atan would be helpful too, with acos available via asin. That would be 4 dropped and 4 added and a net improvement to the calculator adding capabilities that are really not available at the cost of modest conveniences.</p>

	<h3>My Daily Calculator (5 stars)</h3>
	<p>I‚Äôm an accountant and finance professional by trade and need to add numbers, do percentages, etc. on a daily basis. I grew to love RPN calculators (HP 12C) and subsequently could never go back to a normal calculator. Finally an app that is super user friendly and allows me to do RPN calculations on my phone. I‚Äôve by and large ditched my physical calculator, although old habits die hard sometimes. For those working in accounting and need to add up all numbers on a report to check, do yourself a favor and learn RPN! A physical HP12C is a great bet, and for the virtual world, this calculator hits the spot just right.</p>

	<h3>Thanks so much it‚Äôs a time saver !!best rpn reverse Polish notation ever!!! (5 stars)</h3>
	<p>I‚Äôm using this calculator for half year and I will never come to ordinary calculator after this one!</p>

	<h3>Refreshingly simple (4 stars)</h3>
	<p>I echo all the comments made by other reviewers. Please consider making the alt function labels brighter, as I find them difficult to see in less than optimum lighting. Otherwise this is the best RPN calc I‚Äôve come across. Thanks!</p>

	<h3>Thanks, Ashok. Still not working for me, though! (3 stars)</h3>
	<p>Sideways and not fully rendered on iPad Air running iOS 12.4.5. (No landscape view and keypad is not fully visible). I have received a kind email from the developer, who notified me of the update. Unfortunately, when I tried to download it, I was informed it was not compatible, so I took the option to download the latest compatible version as prompted, hoping it might have been fixed at the same time. Sadly, the problem has not gone away. Although it is impossible to use, I have changed my review from 1 star to 3, on the basis of the kindness and effort this guy has put into producing what I'm sure will work well for anyone with the very latest iPad. Dear Ashok; if you want to give me a brand new iPad, I'll happily test your latest version! ;-). Best Wishes. WS.</p>

	<h3>Looks great (4 stars)</h3>
	<p>Simple and beautiful design. Would be perfect if it had support for hardware keyboards.</p>

	<h3>Nice advanced buttons on a simple RPN calculator (5 stars)</h3>
	<p>as the title says, this calculator does what it advertises-RPN calculations work just fine. Nice buttons, adapted for touchscreen technology. Advanced features easily accessible in the menu. Nice work!</p>

	<h3>Great (5 stars)</h3>
	<p>Great to have a well designed RPN calculator with me on my smartphone. For daily use, the layout is much more comfortable than the fully emulated hp calculators.</p>

	<h3>Sum bugs (5 stars)</h3>
	<p>Ok. Thanks for explanation. üëçüòä Just one thing more. If I type 49 and immediately after I take the root (=7) and after that I type ¬´ Pi ¬ª , the 7 disappear instead to be puted on the stack. The same if I type 49 root recall 1 (with something stored in mem No.1). Normally, the result of 49 root would have to be outed in the stack. Sorry for my English üòÑ. Hope you have understand what I talk about.</p>

	<h3>User Friendly (5 stars)</h3>
	<p>Love it! Simple interface not crowded like some of these HP calculator replicas. A lot of functions available and you can customize your most frequent buttons! Well done</p>

	<h3>Great App (5 stars)</h3>
	<p>It has all what I need, it‚Äôs easy and intuitive to work with. Thank you.</p>

	<h3>Nice clean graphics (4 stars)</h3>
	<p>I find most of the RPN calculators too messy. I would prefer the divide function represented by the conventional symbol and the same stack as +-x. The RPN calculator I really want is a direct adaption of the native IOS simple and scientific calculators (which are based on the physical Braun ET 22, designed in the late 70s, early 80s)</p>
